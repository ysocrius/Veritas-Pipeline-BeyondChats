September has unsettled weather. The rainfall is short and light and is not continuous. The end of the monsoon, much like the beginning can feature heavy thunderstorms associated with the withdrawal of the monsoon current from the city and surrounding areas. The mean maximum daily temperatures reach 30.1\u00b0C while daily mean minimum daily temperature stays at 24.0\u00b0C. Cotton clothes are comfortable throughout the year.Places to visitMumbai offers a plethora of delights for the visitor. Of course, no visit to Mumbai is complete without catching a sight of the famous Gateway of India monument. There are many other interesting sights in downtown Mumbai such as the Prince of Wales Museum and the Hanging Gardens and the Rajabhai Clock Tower.The most spectacular sight near Mumbai are the magnificent caves, dedicated to the Hindu Lord Shiva on Elephanta Island, a short boat ride from the downtown jetty. These caves are a must-see and have been declared a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. A two-day trip from Mumbai to the famous Ajanta and Ellora Caves near Aurangabad are equally beautiful, which are also a World Heritage Site worth seeing. For a relaxing break, a trip to the former Portuguese colony of Goa with its pristine beaches and seafood bonanza is recommended.CuisineMumbai offers a wide gastronomic choice with more than a thousand caf\u00e9s and restaurants across the city. Spicy cuisine from various corners of India, fusion cuisine and international cuisine such as Continental, Thai, Japanese, Mexican & Chinese await the discerning palate.Mumbai by nightMumbai is the quintessential city that never sleeps. Trendy pubs and nightclubs are located in the downtown area as well as the suburbs. Many restaurants double up as bars and nightclubs and stay open till late hours. The dazzle of Bollywood movies beckons and even late night movies play to a full house. So don't be surprised if you are caught in a traffic jam at midnight even on a week day.ConnectivityMumbai is well connected by air with the rest of India as well as the world. It has the busiest network of domestic flights, with services to more than 30 cities daily, including flights to Aurangabad near the Ajanta and Ellora Caves and Agra, Jaipur and Kerala.

The treatment cycle itself takes about 2 to 4 weeks to complete, after which the woman must take a pregnancy test to see if the fertilized embryo has implanted or not.The success rates of IVF are very high in India, with some clinics boasting success rates as high as 65%, among women in the 21 to 30 age group. The younger the woman, the higher the chances of a successful IVF pregnancy. As the woman ages, there is a proportionate drop in success rates. However, the success rates offered by IVF in each cycle are higher compared to those of other treatments such as IUI.In many cases, the cumulative success rate of three or more cycles may be upwards of 70%. It means, that women have the most chances of getting pregnant through IVF fertility treatments, and this often justifies the test tube baby cost. The more cycles the woman chooses to undergo, the better the chances of success.Summary: Test tube baby costs in India are comparatively less than what they are in most other countries and people from all over the world come here for their treatment.Not happy with your IVF clinic?

                "text": "How much does a test tube baby treatment cost in Mumbai? Before starting an IVF treatment cycle, one of the first questions the patient needs to know is how much it is all going to cost. They know that the success rate is not 100% and that they may have to repeat many cycles before getting pregnant. IVF is expensive, and it's a big drain on the budget. Because it's not covered by insurance and they need to pay out of pocket, this is something which they need to be very careful about. Now many IVF clinics take out a lot of ads, and in order to lure patients, they advertise at a very low rate. However, they do not explain to the patient that this is just their initial sign-up rate and that as the cycle progresses, the patients will have to keep on paying more and more. These clinics keep on extracting \u00c2 additional amounts during the treatment, as a result of which the total cost for the patient for that cycle balloons up so much that the poor patient ends up spending twice as much as he had budgeted for! This creates even more friction between the husband and the wife, as the husband finds he just does not have enough money to spend on fulfilling his wife's dream of having a baby. This is why it's important to get an upfront cost - preferably a packaged, all-inclusive cost so that there are no unpleasant surprises later on. This is the best way of ensuring that you don't get taken for a ride.\u00c2 For any personal care or IVF treatment, you can directly visit our IVF Clinic in Mumbai.",

Many patients want to travel to Mumbai to do an IVF cycle in our clinic because they know that they will get the best possible medical care. They appreciate the fact that we provide high technology with a high touch, and this combination allows them to maximize their chance of getting pregnant. This blend of competence with compassion is rare, which is why many patients who have failed an IVF cycle and are finally able to differentiate between a good clinic and a bad clinic, seek us out. We create a lot of educational materials to educate IVF patients, and we share this for free online, Patients appreciate our openness and transparency because this helps them to have realistic expectations of IVF treatment.Many patients have failed an IVF cycle, and are not happy with the local options which are available to them, because most clinics hide information from their patients. They refuse to provide photographs of embryos to their patients and make up all kinds of flimsy excuses to explain the IVF failure. Patients get irritated with this opacity, and while they are keen to come to Mumbai for their treatment, they are worried about the logistics of organizing this. Not only have they heard that Mumbai is an expensive city, it's also hard for them to take so much time off from work. Most patients still think that an IVF treatment takes about 20 days, but in our clinic, we have streamlined our treatment protocol so efficiently, that you only need to spend about 7 \u2013 10 days in Mumbai. Also, because of our tie-up with Gopal Mansion (www.gopalmansion.com), the cost of staying is only Rs 800 per night for a couple in an AC room!Your treatment can be started locally in your hometown, so the amount of time you spend in Mumbai gets slashed dramatically, without compromising the quality of your care. Most of our patients are well-informed and are comfortable using email to share medical information with us.I review their medical records, and then send them the treatment plan well in advance, so they can organize their tickets, stay and leave. The husband needs to come for only one day, which makes this even more feasible and convenient.",

Understand the process and make sure you are financially ready for this. Most fertility treatments tend to be expensive which is why you need to be sure that you plan everything from the start. Knowing the right IVF treatment cost is very necessary to ensure that you don\u2019t pay more than necessary. 2-Rate of SuccessIVF cost in India is comparatively low than in other countries such as the U.K. or the U.S., but it is high for the general population. This is why you need to know your chances of success with IVF. Which clinic you select makes a world of a difference, so don't blindly go to the one which is nearest or the one which is cheapest - this may turn out to be a more expensive option in the long run! 3-AgeAge is an important factor with regards to IVF success rates. It's not just your calendar age which we are concerned with - it's the age of your ovaries, as judged by your ovarian reserve. We can test this by checking your AMH level and your antral follicle count.Even for women above the age of 35, reputed IVF clinics like Malpani Infertility Clinic have high success rates for IVF because we can modify your superovulation protocol to help you grow better quality eggs, thus maximizing your chances of getting pregnant. SummaryIVF has given hope to many couples who have tried for years to get pregnant. However, the success rate depends on the quality of the care provided by the clinic, and this does influence the cost of your treatment.",

Lots of out-of-Mumbai patients are reluctant to travel to Mumbai to our clinic for their IVF treatment, even though they know our IVF pregnancy rates are the best in the country. This is because they've been told all kinds of horror stories about IVF treatment. They have been misinformed that they need to visit the clinic everyday; that they need daily ultrasound scans; that they require injections on a daily basis which need to be given at the clinic; they need bed rest after the transfer; and that travel after the embryo transfer is unsafe. They are also warned that IVF pregnancies need special care, and this can only be provided locally, which is why they are scared to come to Mumbai. However, none of this is true at all. These are just myths which are propagated by local IVF clinics in their town, in order to hold onto their patients, and make sure that they don't travel outside the city. This is a shame, because pregnancy rates in these local clinics aren't good, but they don't want to lose their patients. The fact of the matter is that IVF logistics is very simple. We provide a well-defined clear treatment plan which is easy to follow. No hospitalization is required, and patients only need to come to clinic about 4-5 times over a 15 day period.

                "text": "Soon, Stethoscopes, Not Sight-seeing, Could Bring Tourists To City Times of India, By Shabnam Minwalla A few months ago, Dr Niteen Dehia of Laser Eye Vision received an unusual request. A busload of Britishers, who were planning a trip to Goa, wanted to stop over in Mumbai to correct their vision through Lasik surgery. The doctor was happy to oblige, and is now preparing for the 15 bespectacled tourists who will be arriving in December. When Dr. Aniruddha Malpani decided to invest Rs 25 lakhs in equipment for Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis - a technique used to rule out genetic disorders in the embryo- he knew that only the rich and desperate in India would come forward. But he suspected that international patients might be interested. The hunch paid off. Half the inquiries that Dr Malpani has fielded in this connection have come from abroad. And in January, he will be undertaking the highly specialised procedure for an American couple. Recently, a surprised Dr. Kanir Bhatia found himself scheduling appointments around flight timings and tourist itineraries. An American who was coming to India to see the Taj, had decided to undergo a complicated dental procedure as well. If these cases are any indication, more and more visitors are arriving in India for reasons which have as much to do with stethoscopes as sight-seeing. For, given the fact that top-of-the-line medical treatment is available in Mumbai for a fraction of the Manchester or Muscat rate, international patients have actually begun to contemplate facelift-cum-Fatehpur Sikri trips to India. Even if you include the price of the ticket and some sight-seeing, dental work like teeth implants and smile design work out cheaper here, says Dr Bhatia, a cosmetic dentist and implantologist. Concurs Dr Vijay Sharma, a cosmetic surgeon with a steady international clientele, The entire country is focused on the IT revolution. But if we play our cards right, healthcare could well be the next boom. To say that 'medical tourism' is already a trend may be overstating maters somewhat. But there is an undeniable trickle of international patients, especially in areas like cosmetic surgery, cosmetic dentistry, infertility treatment and eye surgery. These branches are often denied insurance in countries like the U.S. and Canada, or are considered extremely low priority by national healthcare systems in countries like the UK.

Doctors are smart, and manyIVF clinics take advantage of this bargain hunting mentality of ignorant patients, who cant look beyond the price. They buy full page ads, and sponsored slots on TV talk shows. Their focus is on highlighting how affordable and cheap they are. They also offer all kinds of bargains and discounts to pure patient in, because they know that once the patient has started a treatment cycle, they cannot back out and are trapped. Please remember that someone needs to pay for these expensive ads and you are the sucker ! These ads are very misleading , because they lure patients in by quoting a low sticker price , and then add all kinds of add-ons once the treatment has started. Smart patients dont focus on only the price, but try to assess the value the clinic offers.

Sadly, IVF clinics aren't usually honest or transparent about the charges. They advertise a particular cost, but the final price which the patient ends up paying is a lot more , because there are all kinds of add- ons. This is why patients often get sticker-shock when they need to pay the bill . The take-home baby price is far more than they had budgeted for ! IVF clinics know that after the patient has started the cycle, they are stuck and cannot back out. Doctors keep upselling and adding lots of new procedures. They convince the patient to buy this by claiming that these will improve their chances of success. This means patients end up forking out much more than they expected ! To add insult to injury, they don't get value for what they're spending ! These clinics dont bother to even provide photos of the embryos to their patients, which is why the pregnancy rates in these clinics is exceptionally low.

However, the heart of the IVF treatment is the IVF laboratory, and the patient doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to see what goes on behind the scenes in the IVF laboratory. This is extremely expensive, because the consumables ( test tubes and petri dishes), and the culture medium are all imported ( which makes them expensive); and disposable, which means we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reuse them.
