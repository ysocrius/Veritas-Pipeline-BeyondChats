                "text": "Donor Egg IVF IVF is a boon for infertile couples who are longing to have a baby. In most instances, it becomes the last resort for these couples, but one that has a significantly high success rate. When a couple comes to us for treatment, and after the first tests and workup has been done, we are able to identify whether the woman and the man have healthy eggs and sperm respectively, in order to be able to conceive via IVF.In case it is found that the quality of the woman\u2019s egg is poor or if the woman doesn\u2019t have any eggs at all, it\u2019s possible for the couple to use donor eggs in their IVF treatment. Other third party reproduction options such as donor sperm, donor embryo and surrogacy are also now being used by couples who are unable to conceive with their own eggs or sperm.Of course, adoption is another course of action for couples that want to have a baby. However, there are times when a woman wants to experience pregnancy and wants to breast-feed her child and go through the early newborn- bonding process- these things aren\u2019t possible with options such as surrogacy and adoption. Take a look at how the donor egg process works.Donor EggsSome women are unable to conceive using their own eggs for a range of reasons.Age-related ovarian failurePremature ovarian failureSurgery for specific pelvic disordersMedical therapies such as chemotherapyIf after the relevant tests, we have identified that the patient is unable to conceive because of any of these reasons, we may discuss the egg donor option with the patient. The donor eggs that are used in the treatment may be obtained via:An anonymous donorThrough an egg bankKnown donor (friend or sister etc)If the patient opts for eggs from an anonymous donor, it takes some time to identify the right donor; once that is taken care of; we then have to synchronize the donor and the recipient cycles.The Pros and ConsIn the egg bank option, the eggs are ready for use and it makes the process quicker. Both these options have their pros and cons. We prefer using frozen eggs, as there are certain risks associated with using fresh eggs. For example, the donor may not respond to the medications as we expect, and she may not be able to produce the number of high quality eggs that are required. In some instances, the donor may just decide she wants to drop-out mid cycle. Our pregnancy rates with frozen eggs from our egg bank are as good as with fresh eggs, since we vitrify these eggs, which means they all survive intact after thawing. Another major advantage of using donor eggs means we don\u2019t need to bother to synchronise the cycles of the donor and the recipient, since the eggs can be used according to the patient\u2019s cycle.",

With the number of women willing to donate their eggs for IVF treatments on the rise and the number of women aged above 40 wanting to have babies rising, clinics are increasingly engaging in egg donor procedure for IVF.Matching the CycleThough some clinics would have you believe that using an egg donor is immensely easier than using your own eggs for an IVF cycle, the truth is that the egg donor procedure for IVF is not all too simple either. In fact, matching the donor's cycle with your own is of critical importance and so it is to ascertain that the donor's eggs are healthy enough to be used. Why is Screening of Eggs Necessary?In any IVF cycle, where the eggs are donated \u2013 by a friend or a relative or by an anonymous donor, a thorough evaluation and screening of each donor is absolutely essential. The screening is performed to ensure that the eggs being used for the IVF treatment would in fact, be useful for the treatment. If the eggs in the donor were of poor quality too, the IVF treatment would fail.The donor should also be made aware of all the egg donor procedure so that she can make an informed choice about the donation. She should be given the option to back out if she has any doubts or concerns. The evaluation and screening of the potential egg donor should ideally serve to protect all the parties \u2013 the recipient, the donor and the offspring resulting from the donation.

If you are over 40 years of age, your doctor is most likely going to tell you that your chances of becoming a mother with your own eggs are very slim.

Once she crosses the threshold of 35 years of age, the quality of her eggs begins to decline. By the time she is 40, the quality of these eggs may have declined to a point where they can no longer be used for conception.There are women who are still able to conceive naturally in their 40s, but that is rare.

Today, because of the availability of ICSI, the need to use donor sperm when doing IVF is restricted only to men with complete testicular failure.Donor eggs can be used for women who have no eggs ( ovarian failure) but who do have a healthy uterus. An embryo resulting from the fertilization of a donor egg and the husband's sperm is placed inside the patient's uterus.A couple may also choose to use donor eggs if the woman has a genetic disease that could be passed on to a child. Donor eggs can also be used in some cases of long standing infertility when other procedures have failed - for example, women with many previous unsuccessful IVF cycles. The use of egg donation is now becoming increasingly commoner , as older women are seeking infertility treatment. Since the chance of a pregnancy in the older woman depends directly upon the quality of her eggs , many older women opt to use donor eggs from younger women - which increases their pregnancy rates dramatically. This also creates headline news, for example, when a menopausal woman has given birth with donor eggs. In rare cases, when both the man and woman are infertile, donor sperm and donor eggs have been used together.Today, because we can freeze and store eggs routinely using vitrification, we use our egg bank for our donor egg IVF program. This allows us to physically match the egg donor and the wife ; synchronise cycles much better; and also guarantee that we will have at least 10 mature donor eggs for the treatment cycle.Egg donation for IVF requires the egg donor to undergo superovulation and ovum aspiration. The donation of eggs carries more risk and inconvenience to the donor than does the donation of sperm.Fig 1. Ultrasound scan of the egg donor after superovulation. She has grown many follicles and is ready for egg retrievalFor donor egg IVF treatment, the patient ( recipient) needs to be treated with hormones, so that her endometrium is primed and is receptive to the embryos at the time of transfer.Fig 2. Mature oocyte cumulus complexFor amenorrheic women with ovarian failure, this can be achieved by treating them with exogenous estrogens and progesterone. Other women who are cycling need to be downregulated with GnRH analogs before starting treatment with exogenous estrogens. For women who are ovulating, we can do the transfer in a natural cycle as well .",

Before In Vitro fertilization (IVF) became popular, women who were over the age of 40 years or those who experience premature ovarian failure had no other options to get pregnant. A diminished ovarian reserve will prevent women from getting pregnant without external help. An IVF procedure with donor eggs helps a woman get pregnant even if she has very low quantity and quality of eggs.Who Needs an Egg Donor?Traditionally, egg donors were required by women who had premature ovarian failure. If they reached menopause before the age of 40, they would need an egg donor to get pregnant. Premature ovarian failure is not very common and affects about 1% of the female population. In this condition, the ovaries cease to function because the egg reserves of the woman are completely depleted.Understanding what Premature Ovarian Failure is The ChangeHowever, in recent times, more women are choosing to have egg donors for their pregnancies. Women who are over the age of 40 may choose to have an egg donor to improve the quality of eggs used in IVF; this subsequently improves the quality of embryos formed and improves the IVF pregnancy rate dramatically ! The good news is that because we use frozen eggs from our egg bank, it's possible for us to closely match physical traits ( height, complexion, colour of eyes, blood group and so on) !Even when the ovarian function is intact in some women, the ovarian reserve is diminished and it would not be easy for doctors to harvest several eggs. Therefore, they have to rely on IVF procedure with donor eggs to become pregnant. As a woman ages, her eggs age too and they become unusable for the IVF procedure.Are You an Appropriate Candidate for IVF with Egg Donor?The IVF procedure with donor eggs is no different from traditional IVF; the only difference being that instead of you, the egg comes from a willing donor. If you have had several failed IVF treatment cycles, the doctor may suspect poor egg quality and recommend that you consider using donor eggs. You may also choose to have an egg donor if you suffer from genetic conditions such as sickle cell anemia, which may be passed on to your child.Learn more about When and Why to Approach an Egg DonorTests before a donor egg IVF cycle ?Your doctor will need to test your uterus for its receptivity ; and that you are physically fit enough to carry a pregnancy. Your husband will also need to provide a sperm sample for this treatment. If there are any abnormalities, your doctor will correct them before you can embark on the path to becoming a mother. SummaryUsing donor eggs is becoming common and the IVF procedure with donor eggs is much easier than traditional IVF treatment. However, it is important to ascertain whether you are a good candidate for the procedure, before embarking on the treatment, because this can be a difficult decision !",

The problem is that it's hard to find good quality egg donors - and because response to superovulation is an unpredictable biological variable, often the number of eggs the clinic is able to collect from an egg donor is uncertain. Tragically, lots of clinics continue to use eggs from a fresh egg donor , and this means that often the egg donor doesn't grow many eggs in the treatment cycle, or they're not able to synchronize the cycles of the donor and recipient properly. This means they up getting only a few eggs from the egg donor; or the timing of the egg collection is not matched properly with the recipient's endometrial receptivity. However, because the clinic has lots of patients, and they don't want to maximise their income, they end up splitting the eggs between lots of recipients ! This is especially true when they fly down \"diva donors\" from overseas for their patients. As a result of this, each patient gets allotted only a few eggs, which means she gets only a few poor quality embryos, and the entire purpose of using donor eggs is lost . These patients not only end up failing fresh IVF cycles with their own eggs, they end up failing these fresh donor egg IVF cycles as well ! The clinic they advises them to do surrogacy - not because they need it , but because the IVF clinic is doing a shoddy job. The irony is that the clinic now earns even more money in the process ! What a tragic farce this has become today. We have an active donor egg IVF program where we guarantee that we can offer you at least 10 mature high quality donor eggs from a high quality fertile donor, because we use only frozen eggs, which has now become the international standard practice.

Because we know that fresh sperm increases the risk of HIV transmission, it's now normal practise all over the world to utilise only frozen sperm for donor insemination. Although this is also true for donor eggs, we continue to use fresh eggs from fresh donors. This is, however, utterly inappropriate, especially now that egg freezing technology has advanced so far. When eggs are vitrified in a good facility with an experienced embryologist who has the needed competence, the survival percentage is 100 percent. To avoid the unintended transmission of HIV\/AIDS through IVF, we should ensure that the only eggs used for donor egg IVF are frozen eggs, just as we do with frozen sperm samples. Not only are frozen eggs safer, but they also have a greater conception rate. It's more safer to use frozen eggs because we know how many there are and can ensure that at least 10 mature eggs will be available for the recipient. When we use frozen eggs, we don't have to worry about synchronising their cycles, which makes it much easier to match the physical characteristics of the egg donor and the receiver. The good news is that thanks to the technology of vitrification ( ultra-rapid freezing), in our clinic, the survival rate after thawing frozen embryos is 100%.

Infertility is an issue that can consume you in a number of ways; it takes an emotional toll as well as a financial one and you end up spending a lot of time and energy on it too. If the treatment is successful, all\u2019s well and good; but the problem arises when things don\u2019t work out the way you had thought they would. It\u2019s true that IVF is an infertility treatment that has a very high success rate and when it is done at a reputed clinic you have very good chances of conceiving. But you have to keep in mind that though we as IVF specialists intervene in the natural process, there is only that much we can do. For example, for men with complete testicular failure, we suggest that they consider other options like using donor sperm, for having a baby. Now, this isn\u2019t a decision that can be taken lightly. The Considerations Regardless of whether you are dealing with genetic or male factor infertility issues or are a single woman or even a lesbian couple who wants to conceive; there are a range of considerations that you should be keeping in view when you are selecting donor sperm: An anonymous sperm donor doesn\u2019t have parental rights over the child conceived from his donation Sperm donors are screened for infectious and genetic diseases All sperm banks keep a profile of the donors and if you have a preference in terms of physical attributes, such as height, skin color, and blood group All-in-all, it\u2019s very important to make a well-informed decision and a well-thought out one while opting to use donor sperm to have a baby.

                "text": "What are the different IVF treatment options ? Whenever we offer patients options during the right way of treatment, they often get confused. So, for example, for older women when they can't get pregnant with their own eggs because they have run out of eggs, one option is using donor eggs, which is someone else's eggs and their husband's sperm, and they carry the baby or do their embryos, which is someone else's eggs and someone else's sperm, which they carry in the uterus and then give birth to the baby Embryo adoption is actually a form of in utero adoption, which means you're adopting a baby that doesn't have either your DNA or your husband's DNA; it's coming from another couple.But you're the one who is pregnant; you're the one who's going to carry the pregnancy; you're the one who's going to give birth to the baby, and it's going to be your name on the birth certificate. So, even though it's an adoption, it's something only you and your husband know. No one else in the world does, which actually has lots of advantages because you don't necessarily need to share exactly what you've done in order to get pregnant with the rest of the world.The good news is that you now have an option. You can choose between a donor egg and a donor embryo. Both of these have pros and cons, and there's no one right answer. So, for example, a donor embryo is usually less expensive than a donor egg because these embryos have already been generated and then it's just a question of transferring them into your uterus. Where do they come from? We don't manufacture them These are spare super numerals that other infertile couples who have done treatment for themselves have generated for themselves and frozen in stock. But because they got pregnant in their own IVF cycle, they're happy to donate these embryos to another infertile couple. And this is a very good way of creating a family and the success rates with both donor egg and donor embryo are good, but when patients have choices, it shouldn't be the doctor who tells them which choice they should adopt, it should be the patient who decides for themselves. You need to own that decision for yourself. It's very tempting to just dump everything on the doctor's plate Yes, Dr., youre the expert. I'm paying you the fees. You tell me what to do. You tell me what's right. It's very easy for the doctor to tell you what to do, but the doctor is not a mind reader. The doctor doesn't know what's going on in your head or what's going on in your heart.",

Should they be trying IVF with their own eggs ? with aggressive superovulation ? or with minimal stimulation ?

In one sense, it doesn't matter whether your absolute number is 0.6 or 1.0 - we know that if the AMH is low, this means you have poor ovarian reserve and will most probably have a poor ovarian response to superovulation, which is why your chances of getting pregnant with IVF will be lesser as compared to someone with a normal AMH. However, the chance is not zero, and this doesn't mean that you should not attempt IVF with your own eggs. After all, these are decisions based on personal patient preference - not on lab values.

As a doctor, I can counsel you as regards your success rates, and while it is true that the pregnancy rates with donor egg will definitely be better as compared to using your own eggs, it's not a simple black or white decision.

Many infertile women will find that when they do a routine vaginal ultrasound scan, the doctor will tell them that they have adenomyosis. This is an especially common diagnosis if they happen to have endometriosis as well, as the two are often associated. Most patients are not sure how they should deal with this adenomyosis. Now, we need to understand that adenomyosis is a wide spectrum of diseases and that a lot of fertile women will have adenomyosis, which is a purely incidental finding, which doesn't affect their fertility at all, because the baby grows within the uterine cavity, whereas adenomyosis is found inside the wall of the uterus (the uterine muscle ) and will not affect pregnancy at all. However, it's very difficult to predict what the effect of adenomyosis is, and because gynecologists love doing surgery, and they enjoy making a diagnosis and finding something to treat, a lot of them become extremely trigger-happy, and when they find patients whose ultrasound report says they have adenomyosis, even if it's quite small, or especially if it forms a nodule, they will often advise surgical excision of the adenomyosis (what is called an adenomyoma). Now this may be fun surgery for the doctor, but it is usually not a good idea for the patient for two reasons. Firstly, the surgery doesn't increase fertility at all, because the adenomyosis was just an incidental finding, which didn't affect your fertility in the first place, and should have been left alone. When you get pregnant, the wall of the uterus will stretch automatically and naturally as the baby grows, and will not affect your pregnancy at all! In fact, the doctor will not even be able to see the adenomyosis once you get pregnant! Secondly, the scarring that the surgery leaves behind will often end up reducing your chance of getting pregnant, even if you do decide to do IVF later on, which is why if it's minimal adenomyosis, it's better to ignore it \u2013 especially If it isn\u2019t affecting your uterine cavity!",

In some women, the uterus is enlarged (upto twice the normal size) and can also be tender and \"boggy\". Vaginal ultrasound shows the uterus is enlarged and bulky, but it's difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of adenomyosis with ultrasound, since the density of the invading endometrial tissue may not differ sufficiently from the surrounding uterine muscle wall. Occasionally the uterus may be described as slightly enlarged in a symmetrical fashion, with a fuzzy shadowy pattern seen in the muscle wall. MRI can also be used to distinguish adenomyomas from fibroid tumors. Medicines dont work Since no medicine eradicates adenomyosis, medical treatments are frustrating for patients as well as physicians . Since the uterus is a hormonally responsive organ, hormones are the mainstay of medical treatment of symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe birth control pills or progesterone pills or shots.Although gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists such as Lupron have been found to reduce uterine symptoms of adenomyosis during treatment, the symptoms return quickly after the medicine wears off. Pain pills, whether over the counter or prescription, can be used to tide the patient over rough spots. Adenomyosis and infertility The relationship between adenomyosis and infertility is still very controversial . Many doctors believe that adenomyosis does not reduce fertility, since it affects only the muscle wall of the uterus. This means that the uterine cavity and the uterine lining in these patients are normal, which means their fertility should be normal as well. However, real effect on fertility is virtually impossible to know since it is so difficult to diagnose the disease in women who have an uterus. If an infertile woman is found to have adenomyosis, we usually do not offer any specific treatment for this diagnosis , as this diagnosis does not affect your treatment options!",

So I kept thinking it's my ovaries who need to produce good quality eggs...My AMH is above 4 (i.e. 1 level below perfect) which says I am not menopausal...And when you do IVF .. ovaries anyways don't have a role beyond producing many good quality eggs at the start.My uterine lining wasn't growing for 9 months post embryos were formed in 2nd fresh IVF cycle. And when it grew to the doctor's satisfaction and we did a transfer.. I got pregnant with ectopic. This the highest BHCG i have had : 6000 levels and i saw it on ultrasound too. Which means the one embryo which managed to travel to a tube implanted well. My tubes were fertile and embryo was good. But what happened to the one embryo which remained in the uterus... I think that got killed... same way the one embryo we transferred last month too got killed. Also the 5 embryos we transferred 2 years back in my first IVF fresh and frozen cycles have got killed.

I kept assuming PCOS was the big issue... not knowing the real issue wasted around 4 years my crucial fertile age.7) measuring the period flow : For a few months in the past .. I haven't got my periods witout medication... I have taken medicines such as mesoprostol etc which are given to empty uterus contents in case of pregnant women.

This makes it useful for predicting your ovarian response in an IVF cycle. Women with low AMH levels are more likely to be poor ovarian responders.Measuring Ovarian Aging - Diminished ovarian reserve, is signaled by reduced baseline serum AMH concentrations. Women with a poor ovarian reserve who have entered the oopause have low levels of AMH. However, this is a new test and is still not easily available.AMH versus FSH :The old standard for ovarian reserve testing was the Day 3 FSH level.However, the FSH level is not as reliable as the AMH level for 3 reasons.The FSH level varies according to the cycle datesIt depends upon the estradiol level ( a high estradiol level will artificially suppress a high abnormal FSH level into the normal range)It varies from cycle to cycle, so is not always reliable or dependableAn AMH level is a much better marker for ovarian reserve. It is much more stable than the FSH level and does not vary from cycle to cycle. Even better, it can be measured on any day of the cycle! This is why most infertility specialists today use AMH to check ovarian reserve, rather than the old FSH level.One confusing thing about AMH is that there are at least 2 scales out there and innumerable clinic definitions of what is \"normal\" - it depends on which assay they use and which study! One scale is ng\/ml and one is pmol\/l. The pmol\/l scale runs from 0 to about 48; the ng\/ml runs from about 0-10. On the ng\/ml scale, less than 2 ng\/ml is considered to be low.Importance of checking AMH level :An AMH level can also be very useful for young women who want to postpone childbearing and want to check their fertility. Many women these days are postponing having a baby in order to pursue a career. The good news is that while usually, fertility does not decline too much until the age of 32, for some women the decision to postpone childbearing can prove to be one they bitterly regret later on. Fertility does decline as a woman grows older, and the problem is that it is not possible to predict the rate of decline for an individual woman.",

However, this occurs within the muscle wall of the uterus, not on pelvic surfaces as does endometriosis. Most commonly, the disease affects the back wall (posterior side) of the uterus. When this occurs, the uterus is enlarged usually more than twice the normal size and very hard. The disease may be localized with well-defined borders ; or diffuse, meaning it has no limits or borders. When the disease is localized , it is called an adenomyoma. These adenomyomas can be located at different depths of the uterine muscle . A matter of underdiagnosis The disease is often under-diagnosed because many doctors do not consider this possibility . Patients who have localized adenomyosis are often misdiagnosed as having fibroids. Others are just labeled as having a \"bulky uterus\" or DUB ( dysfunctional uterine bleeding). This disease can only be diagnosed with 100% certainty by doing a biopsy of the uterine muscle, a procedure which is done very rarely !About 10% of women with adenomyosis have also had endometriosis in other sites such as the pelvic wall, ovaries, fallopian tubes etc. The highest incidence is seen in women in their forties, and though this disease may cause infertility, it usually occurs in women who have already had children. Symptoms As with Endometriosis, patients with Adenomyosis may not show any symptoms (asymptomatic). However, women most commonly experience excessive, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding and painful periods (dysmenorrhea). The amount of bleeding and cramps is usually associated with the degree of disease involvement and depth of penetration into the uterine walls. Extensive involvement of the uterine muscle can also interfere with the normal contractility of the muscle which then leads to excessive bleeding. Diagnosis An exact diagnosis is often difficult to establish pre-operatively because abnormal patterns of bleeding (dysfunctional bleeding) and fibroid tumors can result in similar symptom patterns. Sometimes during a D&C procedure to remove intra-uterine polyps or small fibroid tumors, uterine tissue is removed , enabling a pathologist to make the tissue diagnosis. However, this is often an incidental finding.",

She had irregular cycles for many years, and I had just informed her that the reason for her irregular cycles was the fact that her egg quality was very poor, and that the only way she could have a baby was by using donor eggs. A CaseShe was very upset - and was actually quite angry with me ! She had been going to a gynecologist for the last 3 years in order to try to have a baby. He had diagnosed her as having PCOD ( polycystic ovarian disease) and had told her that this was the reason for her irregular cycles. She was given Duphaston every month to induce a cycle - and had even had 2 IUI cycles done. On reviewing her records, I pointed out to her that her FSH level on more than 2 occasions had been very high - and this confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian failure. Now she was angry with her gynecologist ! Why hadn't he made the right diagnosis ? How could he miss the significance of the high FSH level?The Second Opinion It was not until she came to me for a second opinion did she realise that her high FSH meant she had entered the oopause. She was very bitter, because she had always been very worried about her irregular cycles. However, her gynec had always reassured her, saying - \" Don't worry - you are young ! Your eggs are fine !\" It's important to differentiate between calendar age and ovarian age - and not all young women will have young ovaries ! Unfortunately, for many of these women, the diagnosis is not made in time. The eye only sees what the mind knows, and many gynecs do not even consider the possibility of premature ovarian failure when treating young women, because the majority of their patients are fertile !

If you have more antral follicles, this means that you have a good ovarian reserve and the yield of eggs during your IVF cycle is likely to be high too.When a girl is born, she already has the entire stock of eggs she is ever going to produce in her life. Unfortunately, there is no new egg production in the ovaries after birth, and we cannot coax the ovaries to produce new egg cells. During an IVF cycle, we just grow some of the eggs which are already present in your ovaries. Please do not believe the stem cell scam for increasing ovarian reserve - it is not sound science!What are antral follicles?Antral follicles are small follicles ( ranging in size from 2-7 mm) which are present in your ovaries and can be counted using a vaginal ultrasound scan during the earlier part of your menstrual cycle (day 2 -day 5). These are the follicles that develop in response to the FSH injections given during an IVF cycle. The number of antral follicles in your ovary gives a rough estimate of the number of eggs that will be retrieved from your ovaries in the IVF cycle. The actual egg yield will also depend on the dosage of FSH used to stimulate your ovaries - and how well your doctor monitors your superovulation!) The greater the number of antral follicles, the greater will be the egg yield.A woman with a normal antral follicle count usually has a good ovarian reserve and is more likely to produce a decent amount of eggs which are of good quality. This is why her chances of success with IVF are high too. Women with poor ovarian reserve tend to respond poorly to ovarian stimulation drugs, and their egg yield can be Low. They have a poorer chance of success with IVF.How can I increase my AMH levels?AMH is a hormone that is produced by your antral follicles. If you have more antral follicles, this means that you have a good ovarian reserve and the yield of eggs during your IVF cycle is likely to be high too. Since antral follicles secrete AMH; the more the number of antral follicles, the higher will be your AMH levels. This is why AMH provides an indirect measure of your ovarian reserve. Many women tend to think that since their AMH level is low, their ovarian reserve is poor, but the truth is the other way around - it is because of the poor ovarian reserve that you have low AMH levels. The AMH is just a diagnostic marker of ovarian function. This is why just increasing your AMH will not increase your ovarian reserve. If increasing ovarian reserve was that easy, many biotech companies would have made a huge profit by manufacturing AMH !",

Women with lower AMH have lower antral follicular counts and produce fewer oocytes. AMH levels do not change significantly throughout the menstrual cycle and decrease with age. Healthy women below 38 years old with normal follicular status at day 3 of the menstrual cycle have AMH levels of 2.0 - 6.8 ng\/ml (14.28 - 48.55 pmol\/L). High levels are found in patients with PCOD. AMH levels are more stable than the Day 3 FSH level and can be measured on any day of the cycle. It is useful for young women who want to postpone childbearing and check their fertility potential before doing so. AMH levels can be tested at www.mymedlab.com. If it's low, re-think priorities, but if it's normal, postpone childbearing but have the test repeated every year.

The reason her periods were irregular is because she did not ovulate. This is called anovulation. Now while it is true that the commonest cause for anovulation is PCOD, the other common diagnosis which needs to be ruled out is premature ovarian failure. The high FSH level should have allowed the gynec to make the right diagnosis! When patients have irregular periods, we advise them to do the following tests.Blood tests for the following reproductive hormones: FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone) LH ( luteinising hormone) PRL ( prolactin) AMH ( anti-Mullerian hormone) TSH ( thyroid stimulating hormone) on Day 3 of the cycle,( to check the quality of their eggs). Patients with PCOD have high AMH levels; high LH levels; and a normal FSH levels. Patients with ovarian failure, on the other hand, have high FSH levels and low AMH levels.This diagnosis can be confirmed by doing a vaginal ultrasound scan which checks for ovarian volume and antral follicle count.The Tragedy Patients with PCOD have large ovaries, with an increased antral follicle count. Patients in the oopause have small ovaries and a reduced antral follicle count. The worst tragedy occurs when a patient with anovulation because of poor ovarian reserve is misdiagnosed as having PCOD.Some doctors will do an ovarian drilling for these patients - and this destruction of their normal ovarian tissue will cause them to have iatrogenic ( produced by a physician) premature ovarian failure ! Conversely, we also to see patients with PCOD who have done IVF and have been told by their doctors that they have poor ovarian reserve, because the doctor did not do a good job superovulating them ! It's a pleasure to treat these patients, because with the right superovulation, they have very high pregnancy rates ! If you are unsure of your diagnosis, the single most important test you can do is to check your AMH level. This is a reliable test - and makes it very easy to differentiate between PCOD and oopause !

                "text": "Chocolate Cyst (endometriomas): Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment If the cyst recurs, patients will often go to another surgeon ( who they feel is more expert) to try to correct the problem. The pelvis in some of these patients starts resembling a battle field, because they often end up having many laparoscopies done by many different surgeons, each of whom claims to be the best !The surgery can be extremely challenging in these patients . The scarring , adhesions and previous surgery tend to distort the anatomy and the pelvis sometimes is completely frozen. Operative complications in these cases ( for example, inadvertently opening the bladder or rectum) are not uncommon. The Important Factor The AMH level is a very important factor which many doctors tend to overlook in treating infertile women with endometriosis. The major danger with endometriosis is that the chocolate cyst replaces normal ovarian tissue, as a result of which many of these patients have little normal ovarian tissue and poor ovarian reserve as a result of their disease. This is why it's important to assess your ovarian reserve by checking your AMH level and your antral follicle count before doing anything further ! If your AMH level is low, then it's best to avoid surgery and to move on to IVF to maximize your chances of having a baby quickly ( before the disease becomes worse and eats away more of your precious reserve). About IUIFor young women with normal ovarian reserve, open fallopian tubes ( as proven on HSG) and small chocolate cysts who have no symptoms, it's worth trying IUI before doing anything more aggressive. However , if the patient is symptomatic and the endometriosis is causing pain, then this become a trickier issue !You need to set your priorities - is pain control more important ? Or is having a baby more important ? This is often a difficult decision to make, but you need to decide. It's best to make a list of all your options so you can think through these logically. If having a baby is key, then it's best to manage your pain symptomatically and concentrate your energies on getting pregnant quickly. IVF is very effective , as it maximizes your chances of getting pregnant quickly.The Dual Benefit The beauty with IVF is that it allows you to kill 2 birds with one stone - not only do you get your deeply desired baby, you also have dramatic pain relief for at least 1 year ( because your periods will stop during your pregnancy and your postpartum period ).",

                "text": "Hysteroscopy Most fibroids develop in the wall of the uterus (intramural ) or protrude outside of the uterine wall (subserous fibroids), and these can usually be left alone, since they do not hinder fertility, and neither do they cause problems during the pregnancy. In fact, unnecessary surgery to remove the fibroid often causes more harm than good. This surgery often creates adhesions, which causes the tubes to get blocked. However, if the fibroids are very large, they may need surgical removal, and this procedure is called a myomectomy. Some doctors give an injection of a GnRH analog prior to surgery in order to shrink the fibroid and make surgery technically easier. When performed by an expert, it is a safe and effective procedure which can be accomplished with minimal blood loss.Laparoscopic myomectomyHowever, sometimes because of uncontrollable bleeding the surgeon may be forced to remove the entire uterus (a procedure called a hysterectomy), and this is obviously a disaster for the infertile woman! The standard technique for removing a fibroid is through open surgery (laparotomy). It is now also possible to remove fibroids through the laparoscope, but laparoscopic myomectomy does not allow for optimal reconstruction of the uterus. Submucous fibroids are an important cause of infertility, because they interfere with implantation of the embryo, by acting as a foreign body. These are best removed by an operative hysteroscopy. While surgery can remove the fibroid, it can recur again, and most doctors advise the patient to try to conceive as soon as possible after surgery.Fig 2. Schematic showing a submucous fibroid; and a subserous fibroid compressing the right fallopian tubeFibroids may grow larger during the pregnancy, but usually pregnancy and delivery are uneventful. In rare cases, after a myomectomy, uterine rupture may occur during pregnancy or delivery, and this complication may result in severe blood loss, fetal loss and even maternal death. Because of the potential for catastrophic results, it is recommended that women have cesarean deliveries in the following circumstances: 1) when the myomectomy involved full-thickness incision of the uterine wall or multiple deep uterine incisions or 2) when myomectomy was complicated by infection which may have weakened the uterine wall or 3) when there is doubt regarding the adequacy or extent of the uterine repair. The uterus was often a neglected organ in the infertility workup, partly because we did not have the tools to study it properly. Hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingography and vaginal ultrasound are all complementary procedures for evaluating the uterine cavity in the infertile woman.",
